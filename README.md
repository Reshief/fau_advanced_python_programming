This repository contains the instructions and sample solutions for the course "Advanced Python programming in research projects" at the Friedrich-Alexander-Universtität Erlangen-Nürnberg in the summer semester of 2025. 
There are multiple ways to solve most problems, so feel free to deviate from my implementation. 
Also, if you find an issue with my code, please let me know via email to kevin[[dot]]hoellring[[at]]fau[[dot]]de
